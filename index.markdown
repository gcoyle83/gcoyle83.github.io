Hello and welcome to the content of my GitHub Pages site. There is nothing interesting here yet, but after I create it there will be, depending on what you find interesting. 

For example:
<center>
	<figure>
		<img src="/assets/images/owl.png"
			 width="500"
			 alt="Owl">
		<figcaption>How to draw an owl.</figcaption>
	</figure>
</center>
