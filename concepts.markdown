Here I'll outline the broad concept areas that interest me and drill down where appropriate into more detail. 

## Data Science
This collection of pages introduces core data science concepts that interest me, and includes discussion of why I am interested in them:

-  [Supervised learning](../_data_science/supervised) is a basic machine learning technique that uses examples of input-output mappings to learn a function that takes a new, possibly unobserved, input and estimates its output label (categorical or numeric).

-  [Reinforcement learning](../data_science/reinforcement) is a more advanced machine learning technique that uses the theory of *Markov Decision Processes* and the *Bellman equations* to learn an optimal *policy of action* from an observed *reward signal*.  

## Water Quality
This collection of pages introduces core water quality concepts that interest me and includes discussion of why I am interested in them.
## The Nexus
There are a lot of concepts that interest me, so perhaps the most effective way of summarizing my interests (primarily for myself, as I don't really expect anyone else to read this) is by first defining their common attributes or nexus. 

Rapid list:
-  environmental processes
-  environmental systems modeling
-  environmental protection
-  environmental statistics
-  environmental infrastructure and operations
-  operations research
-  decision theory
-  complex systems analysis
-  game theory
-  probabilistic programming
-  evoloutionary and genetic programming
-  neural information processing (deep learning)
-  Bayesian statistics
-  reinforcement learning
