## Why water quality?
I am very enthusiastic about conserving the beauty of our public (and private) waterways and protecting the fundamental ecosystem services that these environments provide all life on Earth. My earliest appreciation for our rivers and lakes was not until my adolescence in northeast Georgia (United States), when I first began spending long summer afternoons and evenings fishing with friends or sliding down rock falls. That early appreciation was purely recreational, and it wasn't until my late twenties in northeast Vermont that I really began to gain an understanding of the ecology and complexity of wetlands and rivers at the Northwoods Stewardship Center where I was serving in AmeriCorps during the Great Recession. Fly fishing on the Clyde River, paddling across Norton Pond on the Canadian border, ice fishing on Lake Willoughby - all of these recreational activities I enjoyed became a driver to return to school and learn to contribute to their protection.

## What is water quality?
The qualitative answer must come first, as it directly informs the motivation of the quantitative assessment. At least, that's what the United States Congress said in the Clean Water Act when they stated that the primary measure of success in achieving the goals of the CWA was in whether a waterbody was "fishable and swimmable".
