## Why Supervised Learning?
There are a lot of concepts that interest me, so perhaps the most effective way of summarizing my interests (primarily for myself, as I don't really expect anyone else to read this) is by first defining their common attributes or nexus. 

Rapid list:
-  environmental processes
-  environmental systems modeling
-  environmental protection
-  environmental statistics
-  environmental infrastructure and operations
-  operations research
-  decision theory
-  complex systems analysis
-  game theory
-  probabilistic programming
-  evoloutionary and genetic programming
-  neural information processing (deep learning)
-  Bayesian statistics
-  reinforcement learning
