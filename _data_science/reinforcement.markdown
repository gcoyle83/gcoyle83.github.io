## Why Reinforcement Learning?
The reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm is unique in its focus on learning *optimal actions* to be taken by an agent operating a system *over time*. 

## References
I've found the following references very helpful in gaining an understanding of reinforcement learning concepts.

### Primary
Indispensable references: 

-  [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) maintain the authoritative text on the topic, and generously make a PDF version of their book freely available.
-  University of Alberta's [reinforcement learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) requires a Coursera subscription, but is well worth the cost for a professional data scientist, and is a great hands-on complement to the Sutton and Barto text. 

### Secondary
Compelling examples and research applications:

-  Google DeepMind's [autonomous data center cooling system](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/safety-first-ai-for-autonomous-data-centre-cooling-and-industrial-control) is a great example of applied RL for industrial control systems
-  [Seo, et al, 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9474446) provide a compelling use case of applied deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize pump scheduling at a wastewater treatment plant in South Korea.
