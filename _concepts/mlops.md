## [ML Engineering/MLOps](../concepts/mlops)
Whether physics-based, domain-knowledge process models or wholly empirical data-driven models are used (or a combination of the two), these models become stale as new data becomes available. ML Engineering (or MLOps) combines machine learning model development with DevOps principles for continuous improvement/integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD). This is a new field of practice and study, having just emerged in the last few years. In this section I'll collect the best resources I've found to understand the objectives and requirements of MLOps, and begin to outline my own take on the subject as it intersects with the more traditional model development and management lifecycle of water-quality modeling.

Topics to be considered:
-  [MLOps maturity model(s)]()
-  [Standards development]()
-  [Data drift]()
-  [Concept drift]()
-  [Model tracking systems]()
-  [Containerization]()
-  [Distributed computing]()
